# [Augusto Arraes's portfolio](https://augusto2.fly.dev/)

This is a repository for the code of my personal website.

## Idea

This project was created with 2 intents: Introducing me to a practical application of Ruby and Ruby on Rails, as well as giving me the opportunity of showing my skills to find a full time position as a developer.

I added an iframe with a chatbot I built with Python + Flask (code is on [this repo](https://github.com/gutoarraes/bot)) because I wanted to learn more about UI and how to make use of it in an actual application. I didn't train the AI, even though I believe that would be fairly simple given the documentation. But since my primary interest was to make it work and add it to an application I will add it as a future improvement to actually train it.

It's not a particularly pretty website, but **done** *is better than perfect*.

## Build

I chose to create this as a landing page for the sake of simplicity in styling and navigation. I went through a few of iteration of color schemes and ultimately gave up as I don't trust my own taste for these things.

I used Hotwire to make changes to CSS and HTML to take effect on a local server

### Technologies

* Framework: Ruby on Rails,
* Launguages: Ruby, HTML
* Libraries: Bootstrap
* Hosting: Fly.io

## What I learned

1. I realized after starting the project that I wasn't going to need a lot of Rails in it, so that was unfortunate.
2. I used mostly HTML+CSS for styling and adding content, with the small exception of adding a few images and managing the production side of the website with Fly.io.
3. You can't just add an HTML class to something and expect things to work. Life is not that easy.
4. Found a rails gem (hotwire) to make HTML+CSS changes take effect in a live web-app.
5. Reminded myself that front end can be fun.
6. Ruby on Rails is very powerfull.

## Improvements

- [ ] I didn't spend a lot of time in making the website responsive, so this could be an idea for the future.
- [ ] Make the chatbot UI look better
- [ ] Train the chatbot AI.
