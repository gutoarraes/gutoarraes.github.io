# https://augustodev.herokuapp.com/ - not up 

This is a repository for the code of my [personal website](https://augustodev2.herokuapp.com/). 

## Idea

This project was created with 2 intents: Introducing me to a practical application of Ruby and Ruby on Rails, as well as giving me the opportunity of showing my skills to find a full time position as a developer.

## Build

I chose to create this as a landing page for the sake of simplicity in styling and navigation. I went through a few of iteration of color schemes and ultimately gave up as I don't trust my own taste for these things.

Initially I planned on hosting the website on GitHub (as you may notice by this repos name), but I quickly learned we can't host dynamic websites in the platform, so I adapted and found [Codemy's amazing guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT23tcKRVvI) for hosting on Heroku.

### Technologies

* Framework: Ruby on Rails, CSS, Bootstrap
* Launguages: Ruby, HTML
* ~~Database:~~
* Hosting: Heroku

## What I learned

1. I realized after starting the project that I wasn't going to need a lot of Rails in it, so that was unfortunate. 
2. I used mostly HTML+CSS for styling and adding content, with the small exception of adding a few images and managing the production side of the website with Heroku.
3. You can't just add an HTML class to something and expect things to work. Life is not that easy.
4. It's not a particularly pretty website, but **done** *is better than perfect*.

## Improvements

- [ ] I didn't spend a lot of time in making the website responsive, so this could be an idea for the future.
- [ ] I have to change the hosting platform to Fly.io since Heroku doesn't have free tier plans anymore.
